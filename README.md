# Android: SampleListApp - MVP

This is a basic list application that is designed using the MVP pattern with Retrofit 2, OkHttp3, RecyclerView, and CardView.  It fetches a list of heroes from a hosted JSON file and filters out null and no-named (empty) heroes.  It groups them by their ID and then alphabetically sorts then in ascending order.
